    \section{Introduction}
    Introduce the context and the problem here.

    \section{Methodology}
    Talk about how we're solving the problem (C++, TACC super computer) and how the program works (e.g. reads in text file, spits out text file). Then go into the development process (start simple with address/list classes, test functionality then expand it a bit)

    \section{Results}
    Pretty pictures go here. Describe each situation being displayed and talk about what they mean, e.g. is it the optimal solution? Good enough? Is there a tradeoff between time to execute and quality of results?

    Hmm, maybe insert a table comparing number of nodes/trucks to program execution time. What rate does it increase at $(O(n), O(n^2), \&c.)$

        \filldraw (0, 1) circle (2pt);
        \draw (4, 5) --(0, 0);

    \subsection{Difficult Single-Truck Case}

    \section{Conclusion}
    Talk about what we learned, how this all applies to industry, ideas to scale the problem up, \&c.
